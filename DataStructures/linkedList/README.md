# Linked List

In order to revise this topic full i need to cover the following topics 

1. Insertion
    * Recursion
    * Iteration ( do while loops)
    * iteration ( while loop )
2. Deletion ( At the end)
3. Deletion ( At the start)
4. Deletion ( At any positio)
5. Get the length of a linkedList
    * Recursion
    * Iteration ( do while loops)
    * iteration ( while loop )

## Advantages of each
* Double-Linked-List
The Double Linked List takes o(1) to insert at the end of the list
It takes o(1) to delete the header
It takes o(1) to insert the new header
It's easier to reverse the list

<!-- Disadvantages of each -->
It takes o(n) to find a node in worse case
It takes o(1) to find a node if it's a head or tail
It consumes more memory

* Singly-Linked-list
The Double Linked List takes o(1) to insert at the end of the list
It takes o(1) to delete the header

<!-- Disadvantages of each -->
It takes o(n) to find a node in worse case
It takes o(1) to find a node if it's a head
It consumes more memory
It's possible to reverse the list but consumes a lot of memory
