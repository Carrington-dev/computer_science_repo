## What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenarios.

## Key Characteristics of Design Patterns
__Reusability:__ Patterns can be applied to different projects and problems, saving time and effort in solving similar issues.
__Standardization:__ They provide a shared language and understanding among developers, facilitating communication and collaboration.
__Efficiency:__ By using established patterns, developers can avoid reinventing the wheel, leading to faster and more reliable development.
__Flexibility:__ Patterns are abstract solutions that can be adapted to fit various contexts and requirements.

## Why Learn Design Patterns?
There are several reasons to learn design patterns:

__Improve Code Quality:__ Design patterns help in creating code that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend. They promote best practices and provide solutions that have been tested and proven effective.

__Enhance Problem-Solving Skills:__ Learning design patterns equips developers with a book of standard solutions to common problems. This enables them to quickly and effectively address similar challenges in various projects.
__Promote Reusability and Efficiency:__ By applying design patterns, developers can create reusable components that can be used across multiple projects. This reduces redundancy and saves development time.
__Learn from Experts: Explanation:__ Design patterns are derived from the collective experience of skilled developers and architects. Learning these patterns allows developers to benefit from the wisdom and insights of industry experts.

## Types of Software Design Patterns

### There are three types of Design Patterns:

1. Creational Design Pattern
2. Structural Design Pattern
3. Behavioral Design Pattern
